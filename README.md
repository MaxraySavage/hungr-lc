# Hungr - a recipe sharing platform
Hungr is a web application for saving and sharing recipes between users.  It was built with Spring MVC, thymeleaf, Bulma, hibernate, and MySQL.

Hungr is deployed on Heroku [https://hungr-dev.herokuapp.com/](https://hungr-dev.herokuapp.com/) however the deployed version may not mirror the current version here in the repo.

## Goals
Create a way for people to easily save, share and try out new recipes without having to read a novel and fight through a bunch of popup advertisements.

## Technologies Used
Hungr is built with the following technologies:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Bulma
* HTML
* Thymeleaf
* CSS
* Javascript

### Why these technologies?
I chose to use the Spring Boot, ThymeLeaf, MySQL set of technologies because I thought of this project as a capstone of sorts with the LaunchCode bootcamp curriculum.

However, instead of using bootstrap, I chose to use Bulma because I liked how it looks and because Bulma includes no Javascript.
I learned a lot by writing the javascript to make all my forms and other components work as I wanted them to.

Bulma did have serious downsides and I don't think I would use it again. 
#### Bulma does not meet important accessibility criteria
Bulma doesn't meet contrast guidelines and a lot of the suggested ways of using Bulma's components in the docs are decidedly *un*-semantic.
I regret not realizing the extent of these issues until late in development.
